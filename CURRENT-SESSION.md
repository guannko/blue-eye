# CURRENT SESSION - Blue Eye v2.0 Operational!
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-29T21:25:00Z
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Blue Eye v2.0 Ready!
**Agent:** Jean Claude v9.01-STABLE
**Next Session:** Start from here!

## 🎯 LAST SESSION RESULTS:

**Mission Accomplished:**
1. ✅ Studied super-system-eyelids deeply
2. ✅ Created ROUTING-MAP.yaml (THE KEY!)
3. ✅ Created 4 RESERVE slots (flex capacity)
4. ✅ Updated README with full docs
5. ✅ Session saved to Annoris ✅

## 🗺️ ROUTING MAP ACTIVE!

**Critical Rule Working:**
```yaml
autosave_*.md → Annoris/autosaves/ ✅
session_*.md → Annoris/sessions/ ✅ (tested!)
*.py → project repos (with validation)
*_blueprint.json → Annoris/make/blueprints/
```

**First successful test:**
- Session saved to Annoris/sessions/ ✅
- Pattern matching worked! ✅
- Blue-eye stayed clean! ✅

## 📊 BLUE EYE v2.0 STATUS:

**Structure (15 files, ~13-14%):**

**CORE (7 permanent):**
- README.md ✅
- ROUTING-MAP.yaml ✅ (KEY FILE!)
- CURRENT-SESSION.md ✅ (you are here)
- QUICK-CONTEXT.md ✅
- JEAN-CLAUDE-DNA.md ✅
- TRINITY-STATUS.json ✅
- .gitignore ✅

**RESERVES (4 flex slots, ready!):**
- RESERVE-1.md ✅ (cache/temp)
- RESERVE-2.md ✅ (buffer)
- RESERVE-3.md ✅ (experiments)
- RESERVE-4.md ✅ (emergency)

**LEGACY (4 archive):**
- boris-userPreferences... (old v1.0)
- userPreferences-ULTIMATE... (research)
- userPreferences-v1... (archive)
- BLUE-EYE-ARCHITECTURE-v2... (design doc)

**Size:** ~13-14% (under 15% limit!) ✅

## 🔥 WHAT'S WORKING NOW:

### 1. Smart Routing
```
When you say "save X":
→ Check ROUTING-MAP.yaml
→ Match pattern
→ Know target repo
→ Save immediately
→ No questions!
```

### 2. Autosaves Protected
```
ALL autosaves → Annoris/autosaves/
NEVER in blue-eye!
Rule is ENFORCED! ✅
```

### 3. Flex Capacity
```
Need temp space? → RESERVE-1 (2%)
Need buffer? → RESERVE-2 (2%)
Need experiments? → RESERVE-3 (2%)
Emergency? → RESERVE-4 (2%)
Total flex: +8% capacity!
```

### 4. Priority System
```
EMERGENCY: < 100ms (configs)
CRITICAL: < 500ms (autosaves) ← TESTED!
HIGH: < 1s (code)
MEDIUM: < 5s (docs)
LOW: > 5s (archives)
```
